# SkillTrust – Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 1.0 (MVP)  
**Date:** August 12, 2025  
**Status:** In Development  

---

## 1. The Problem
Hiring managers and entrepreneurs struggle to efficiently and confidently vet freelance talent. They must manually check multiple platforms (LinkedIn, Upwork, Fiverr), each with its own biased review system. This process is time-consuming, subjective, and increases the risk of bad hires. There is no single, trusted source of truth for a freelancer’s verified skill and cross-platform reputation.

---

## 2. The Solution
SkillTrust is an iOS application that serves as a trust-aggregation layer for the freelance economy. It provides a unified view of a freelancer’s profile by consolidating reviews, work history, and ratings from major platforms.  
**Key Differentiator:** A proprietary (mocked for MVP) AI-powered *Skill Verification Score*, which analyzes a freelancer’s portfolio and reviews to objectively measure expertise.
